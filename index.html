        <p>Right now my major is in Biology but I will probably change it.
         I love to watch movies and hang out with friends. </p> 
        <p> My favorite quote is from a talk by 
        Elder Von G. Keetch. The quote is from a Australian local and 
        he says this to the surfers.</p>
        <p> "Don't be too critical of the barrier,
        it's the only thing that's keeping you from being devoured."</p>
