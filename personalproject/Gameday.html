                    <p>Football games are once a week, but they are on different days. Normally the games are on Sundays, but they are also on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Sometimes, the different teams have a bye week where they do not play a game. Some of the games are even held in other countries. Like, this week, the Chiefs and the Dolphins are having a game in Germany. Then there are a bunch of different stadiums for every team. </p>
