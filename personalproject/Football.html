                    <h1>The Game</h1>
                    <p>People normally hate football because they cannot understand it. I am not an expert on the subject, but I know enough to enjoy the game. I am going to try to explain it so that maybe you can understand it too. So overall, the teams want to push their way to the opposite side of the field to score. The offense gets 4 chances to gain 10 yards and they are called downs. If they get to the fourth down, then they give the yardage to the other team. There are a bunch of ways to gain points, and some are getting a touchdown, 2-point conversion, field goal, or a safety. A touchdown is worth 6 points and it is when the offense gets the ball in the in zone. Then after the touchdown, they can kick the ball through the yellow goalpost for an extra point. Instead of the extra point, the team can do a two-point conversion where if they get the ball in the in-zone again, then they get 2 points instead of just getting one from kicking. A field goal is worth 3 points and they get in a certain range to where they can kick it in between the yellow goalpost. A safety is kind of rare, but it still happens. It is worth 2 points and it is when the quarterback is taken down inside their own in zone.</p>
