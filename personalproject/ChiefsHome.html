                    <p>The Kansas City Chiefs are an NFL team from Kansas City, Missouri. People think that they are from Kansas just because they have Kansas in the name, but Kansas City is in both of the states. The Chiefs only have three Super Bowl wins in total. The first one was in the year 1970 against the Minnesota Vikings. Then the second Super Bowl was in 2020 against the San Francisco 49ers. Finally, the third one was in 2023 against the Philadelphia Eagles. The two newest Super Bowl wins were because of Patrick Mahomes. </p>
